  "description": "The NOAA HRRR is a real-time 3km resolution, hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model, initialized by 3km grids with 3km radar assimilation. Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min over a 1-hour period adding further detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation from the 13km radar-enhanced Rapid Refresh (RAP) system. This specific collection represents 2D surface levels.",
